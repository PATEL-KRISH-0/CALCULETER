Hello!

This code is an HTML document that creates a simple calculator interface. It showcases how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used together to build a functional calculator. The code is well-structured and includes detailed comments to aid in understanding.

The HTML structure defines the layout of the calculator, with separate sections for the result display and the number and operator buttons. The CSS styles control the visual appearance of the calculator, including the colors, sizes, and responsiveness for different screen sizes.

The JavaScript code handles the calculator's functionality. It captures user input by listening for button clicks and performs the corresponding operations. The code dynamically updates the result display based on the user's interactions. It includes functions for appending numbers and operators, performing calculations, and resetting the calculator.

By examining and experimenting with this code, you can gain insight into DOM manipulation, event handling, and data manipulation in JavaScript. It demonstrates how to select and modify HTML elements, respond to user actions, and perform calculations based on user input. This code is an excellent resource for beginners to grasp the fundamentals of web development and apply them to create interactive applications.

Feel free to explore and enhance the calculator's features. You can extend it to handle additional operations or improve the user interface. This code serves as a starting point for building more complex calculators or exploring other web development concepts.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
